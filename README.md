# Building in the Twenty-First Century.

This project is heavily inspired by James Hague on [programming in the twenty-first century][0].  

The prog21 blog has brought me a lot of joy, laughter and insight throughout the years. I hope you get at least one of those from reading what I write. 

Enjoy!
